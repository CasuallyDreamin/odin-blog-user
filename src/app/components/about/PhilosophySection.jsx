        I believe creation is a language of thought. When traditional forms of expression fail,
        code becomes the medium to explore ideas, systems, and meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every system I build — whether software, a tool, or a game — is an experiment
        in understanding constraints, logic, and human interaction. Efficiency and elegance
        are not just technical goals; they reflect a clarity of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value frameworks that illuminate rather than obscure, and tools that empower
        rather than limit. Growth often comes from failure, reflection, and iteration,
        not from following pre-defined paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, my work aims to bridge thought and experience. Games, systems, and
        collaborative projects are all vehicles to explore ideas, communicate philosophy,
        and invite others to engage on their own terms.
